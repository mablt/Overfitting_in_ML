# Overfitting in Machine Learning

Python3 notebook to present overfitting using diabetes dataset. 

## Motivation
This repository store code implementation used during *Research and Development Initiation* course (Master of Bioinformatics, University of Bordeaux). The aim is to provide a simple explanation of overfitting in machine learning. The notebook which contains implementation is available [here](https://github.com/mablt/Overfitting_in_ML/blob/master/overfitting_in_machine_learning.ipynb). Datasets used are also present in this repository.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required for execution :
* matplotlib
* pandas
* numpy
* sklearn
